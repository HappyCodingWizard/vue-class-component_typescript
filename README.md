# [DEPRECATED] Vue Class Component


## ⚠️ Notice

This library is no longer actively maintained. It is no longer recommend to use Class-based components in Vue 3. The recommended way to use Vue 3 in large applications is Single-File Components, Composition API, and `<script setup>`. If you still want to use classes, check out the community-maintained project [`vue-facing-decorator`](https://facing-dev.github.io/vue-facing-decorator/#/).
